12/12/18, 7:17 PM - DD: Free Domain Policy
If you register a domain with Bluehost when signing up for a hosting account, there is a domain fee that is non-refundable. This not only covers our costs, but ensures that you won't lose your domain name. Regardless of the status of your hosting service, you'll be free to manage it, transfer it after any required lock periods, or simply point it elsewhere at your convenience. You retain ownership of your domain until the end of its registration period unless you elect to extend it.

1/21/19, 6:50 AM - Dexter: *FAQ*

IS THERE A REGISTRATION FEE FOR THE MISS UNIVERSE ANAMBRA PAGEANT?
No. Potential contestants would neither purchase forms nor pay entry fees. Registration is totally free.

WOULD I BE REQUIRED TO PAY CAMP FEE?
No. Potential contestants don't get to pay Camp fee as everything; Meals, Resort/Hotel and other logistics, would be fully sponsored and paid for.

HOW CAN I ENTER THE MISS UNIVERSE ANAMBRA PAGEANT?

To enter the Miss Universe Anambra Pageant; visit www.missuniverseanambra.com, click the 'Register' button, fill in details, submit and if the panel shortlisting deem you fit to contest, you are in.

WHO ARE THE PANEL SHORTLISTING?

A league of well-experienced ex-beauty queens, pageant managers and creative directors of various pageants make up the panel.

IS THE MISS UNIVERSE ANAMBRA PAGEANT OPEN TO JUST GIRLS FROM ANAMBRA STATE?

No. The competition is open to every young woman of Igbo origin.

WHY IS "ANAMBRA" A PART OF THE TITLE IF IT IS NOT OPEN TO JUST GIRLS FROM THE STATE?
The organization has chosen Anambra as host site for every edition of the pageant. The infrastructure of the state's capital city plus capabilities of venue(s) within for production has made it the Organisation's first choice, unless otherwise stated as a result of a few uncontainable contingencies.

ARE THERE AGE REQUIREMENTS?

Yes. Potential contestants for the Miss Universe Anambra Pageant must be at least 18 and under 28 years of age before January 1st in the year they wish to compete.

CAN I BE MARRIED?

No. Potential contestants for the Miss Universe Anambra Pageant must not be married or pregnant. Titleholders are also mandated to remain unmarried throughout their reign.

CAN I COMPETE MORE THAN ONCE?

Contestants who do not make it to being Titleholders may compete more than once if they so wish, whereas Titleholders cannot.

HOW CAN I BEST PREPARE FOR THE PAGEANT?
Potential contestants should understand the values of the Miss Universe Anambra Organisation and the responsibilities of the title. They must be able to express what their goals would be during their reign. It is also important they converse preparing for the pageant with family, friends and a manager (if they have any) so as to garner enough support. But most importantly, they should critically consider these:

What are your aspirations and why you are competing for the title?
What can you do in your community to show leadership and be a role model?
How would you use your title to impact society?
What would be your major focus and why?
What issues do you see around and how would you help solve them?
How can you make the society a better place if crowned?

WHAT ARE THE MISS UNIVERSE ANAMBRA ORGANISATION LOOKING FOR IN CONTESTANTS?

The organisation searches for smart, beautiful and confident contestants. They must be able to show these qualities often even amidst great pressure as they try to persuade both the organisation and teeming audience to believe in their ambitions to become titleholders.

HOW IS THE COMPETITION JUDGED?

Right from Casting to Camping, there is an overall assessment of every contestant, their aspirations and goals. Hours to competition finale, this is handed to Judges who make the final decision with help from the crowd. The competition is judged by successful Entrepreneurs, Entertainers and public figures.

HOW MANY CONTESTANTS COMPETE IN THE MISS UNIVERSE ANAMBRA PAGEANT?

There is no fixed number. Each year, many contestants get shortlisted by the panel, but only those who meet the Organisation's prerequisites and successfully scale the Preliminaries make it to Finale.

WHAT DOES MISS UNIVERSE ANAMBRA DO AFTER SHE IS CROWNED?

After a Winner is crowned, she is handed her car, cash and other prizes. With the organisation's help, the Winner is provided a platform for possibility based on her objectives for the year. Alongside the Miss Universe Anambra Organisation, she will plan how to achieve her goals immensely.

IS THE MISS UNIVERSE ANAMBRA PAGEANT DIFFERENT FROM MISS ANAMBRA?

Yes. The Miss Universe Anambra pageant is totally different from Miss Anambra. Irrespective of the fact that some ladies may choose to compete in both pageants, both organisations and systems are entirely distinct.
